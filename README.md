## Sequential Circuits

From state diagram or state table, this web app is capable of producing 
1. State table
2. Implication table
3. Merger diagram
4. Maximal compatibles and incompatibles
5. Optimal covering
6. Reduced state table
7. Transition Table
8. Kmaps
9. Latch and output equations

The app provides an interactive interface to quickly draw state diagrams. It also gives sufficient flexibility with order of states appearing in state table, state assignments and latch type making it suitable for verifying works of others.

## Combinational Circuits

This app can simplify functions from sum of minterms or product of maxterms form.
It can produce KMaps with boxes showing the terms of simplified expression.
It can also produce steps of tabulation method.
